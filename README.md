# E-Commerce Data Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of real-world online retail data from the UK. It explores customer behavior, sales trends, product popularity, and revenue insights using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Product-level analysis using clustering and seasonal trends
- Revenue trends across weeks, customer segments, and product categories
- WordCloud visualization of product names
- Customer segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Import.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and visualizations
- `images/` — Output visualizations auto-extracted from the notebook

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- WordCloud
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Dataset

This dataset originates from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) and is used on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anmoltripathi/complete-e-commerce-analysis/input) for analysis.
